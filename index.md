Let's get together to try to make things and/or make things that make things better for everyone!

This is not a competitive event. It is not just about coding or design. Anyone is welcome, providing they're interested in working in a team and making a thing.

Teams should aim to produce something during the hackathing, but you don't need to have an idea, OR a team, before you show up.

Teams could produce:

* Plans or mockups for a future digital thingy (app, website etc)
* Slideshow detailing an idea for a business/charity/event
* Set of guidelines or a body of text helping people through some
difficult process
* A queer comic book, zine or a work of art
* An app/website
* A petition to the government/a governing body
* Guidelines for venues/governments/schools/whatever on how to be more inclusive
* Clothing repairs, alterations for your body
* <*Insert your own brilliant, creative idea here* >
* A cake to feed the other humans

It's all good. Just make a thing.
