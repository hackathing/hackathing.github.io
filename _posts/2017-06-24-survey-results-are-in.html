    For a while, I've wanted to set up a coding school. People often ask me why, and the answer is simple: I feel like I should help people, and I feel like I can.
</p>

<p>
    Less clear are the specifics, for example: what course material, what lesson format, how often should it run, etc.
</p>

<p>
    On 2017-06-13 I released a survey to my friends and family on Facebook, and to my coworkers at <a href="https://www.theappbusiness.com/">The App Business</a> where I'm currently contracting. If you'd like to fill it out, you can see it here: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/6vM9SNYQJqq4RdSL2">https://goo.gl/forms/6vM9SNYQJqq4RdSL2</a>

<h3>Mentors and Students</h3>
<blockquote>Are you interested in being a student or mentor?</blockquote>
<p>
    As an incredibly rough guess, I would estimate that I would need about 1 instructor per 5 students, depending on course format.
</p>
<div id="graph_student_vs_mentor"></div>
<p>
    This is a great ratio! If I could get this proportion of people to attend this would be perfect.
</p>

<h3>Course Material</h3>
<blockquote>What would you like to learn about? (if you want to mentor, answer which you feel like you would be able to mentor)</blockquote>
<p>
    The options were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to make a mobile app from scratch</li>
    <li>How to make a website from scratch</li>
    <li>How to make physical things e.g. electronics, soldering</li>
    <li>How the Internet works</li>
    <li>How computers and computer programs work</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_subject_preferences"></div>
<p>
    This was pretty close, with apps getting 22 and websites getting 20. I'm much more comfortable with websites than mobile apps, so I'm going to be teaching how to make a website for the first set of sessions. There's definite interest for apps, so it's possible that the second set of sessions will focus on this.
</p>
<p>
    I will also cover how the Internet works, and to some extent how computers and computer programs work. Unfortunately there weren't enough instructors to teach making electronics, so I won't be covering this for now.
</p>
<p>
    There were also a few write-ins, notably for Python, WordPress and Twitter Bots.
</p>

<h3>Pre-existing ideas for what to build</h3>
<blockquote>Is there anything you already know you'd like to build? If so, what is it?</blockquote>
<p>
    This was a pure write-in question. Most of these were either website or app based, some with a specific business use in mind. One was to build a portfolio website for themself as a freelancer, which is very doable as a project!
</p>

<h3>Course format</h3>
<blockquote>What course format would you prefer?</blockquote>
<p>The options were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One set course, each session building
        on the knowledge of previous session</li>
    <li>Many smaller courses, each one
        spanning a few sessions</li>
    <li>Standalone lessons or workshops</li>
    <li>No fixed agenda, bring your own
        projects and get help from the
        instructors.</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_course_format"></div>
<p>
    There is no clear winner here! The one set course is slightly more popular, and it's what I feel more comfortable teaching, so it's the one I'll go with initially. I'll try to break it down into smaller chunks that are useful on their own.
</p>

<h3>Session format</h3>
<blockquote>What session format would you prefer?</blockquote>
<p>The options were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lectures/talks for entire session</li>
    <li>Short lecture at beginning to introduce
        concepts, followed by working on
        exercises with help from instructors</li>
    <li>Social, no fixed structure other than
        instructors are there to help</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_session_format"></div>
<p>
    This one has a clear winner, labs-style workshops, which I also agree with.
