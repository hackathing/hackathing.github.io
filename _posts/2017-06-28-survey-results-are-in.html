    For a while, I've wanted to set up a coding school. People often ask me why, and the answer is simple: I feel like I should help people, and I feel like I can.
</p>

<p>
    Less clear are the specifics, for example: what course material, what lesson format, how often should it run, etc.
</p>

<p>
    On 2017-06-13 I released a survey to my friends and family on Facebook, and to my coworkers at <a href="https://www.theappbusiness.com/">The App Business</a> where I'm currently contracting. If you'd like to fill it out, you can see it here: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/6vM9SNYQJqq4RdSL2">https://goo.gl/forms/6vM9SNYQJqq4RdSL2</a>
</p>

<h3>Mentors and Students</h3>
<blockquote>Are you interested in being a student or mentor?</blockquote>
<p>
    As an incredibly rough guess, I would estimate that I would need about 1 instructor per 5 students, depending on course format.
</p>
<div id="graph_student_vs_mentor"></div>
<p>
    This is a great ratio! If I could get this proportion of people to attend this would be perfect.
</p>

<h3>Course Material</h3>
<blockquote>What would you like to learn about? (if you want to mentor, answer which you feel like you would be able to mentor)</blockquote>
<p>
    The options were:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to make a mobile app from scratch</li>
    <li>How to make a website from scratch</li>
    <li>How to make physical things e.g. electronics, soldering</li>
    <li>How the Internet works</li>
    <li>How computers and computer programs work</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_subject_preferences"></div>
<p>
    This was pretty close, with apps getting 22 and websites getting 20. I'm much more comfortable with websites than mobile apps, so I'm going to be teaching how to make a website for the first set of sessions. There's definite interest for apps, so it's possible that the second set of sessions will focus on this.
</p>
<p>
    I will also cover how the Internet works, and to some extent how computers and computer programs work. Unfortunately there weren't enough instructors to teach making electronics, so I won't be covering this for now.
</p>
<p>
    There were also a few write-ins, notably for Python, WordPress and Twitter Bots.
</p>

<h3>Pre-existing ideas for what to build</h3>
<blockquote>Is there anything you already know you'd like to build? If so, what is it?</blockquote>
<p>
    This was a pure write-in question. Most of these were either website or app based, some with a specific business use in mind. One was to build a portfolio website for themself as a freelancer, which is very doable as a project!
</p>

<h3>Course format</h3>
<blockquote>What course format would you prefer?</blockquote>
<p>The options were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>One set course, each session building
        on the knowledge of previous session</li>
    <li>Many smaller courses, each one
        spanning a few sessions</li>
    <li>Standalone lessons or workshops</li>
    <li>No fixed agenda, bring your own
        projects and get help from the
        instructors.</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_course_format"></div>
<p>
    There is no clear winner here! The one set course is slightly more popular, and it's what I feel more comfortable teaching, so it's the one I'll go with initially. I'll try to break it down into smaller chunks that are useful on their own.
</p>

<h3>Session format</h3>
<blockquote>What session format would you prefer?</blockquote>
<p>The options were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lectures/talks for entire session</li>
    <li>Short lecture at beginning to introduce
        concepts, followed by working on
        exercises with help from instructors</li>
    <li>Social, no fixed structure other than
        instructors are there to help</li>
</ul>
<div id="graph_session_format"></div>
<p>
    This one has a clear winner, labs-style workshops, which I also agree with.
</p>

<h3>Focus on people who are under-represented in tech</h3>
<blockquote>Some other organisations (e.g. Code First: Girls, Code Bar, Trans*Code) focus on people who are under-represented in tech, would something like this be positive/negative for you?</blockquote>
<p>
    I have a lot of admiration for these other organisations, and wanting to help people is a big part of why I'm doing this. I wanted to see if other people felt the same way.
</p>
<p>
    I broke it down into either making the event exclusively for people who self-define as underrepresented in tech, having some support, and doing nothing. I asked people if they felt positive/neutral/negative about those options.
</p>
<p>
    Only for under-represented people:
</p>
<div id="graph_under_represented_exclusive"></div>
<p>
    Under-represented people are given extra support in some way but not exclusive:
</p>
<div id="graph_under_represented_somewhat"></div>
<p>
    No action:
</p>
<div id="graph_under_represented_none"></div>
<p>
    It's going to be a free event, so that's one difficulty removed that would affect people who are underrepresented. However another thing I could do is have a percentage of the entrance tickets reserved for people who identify as under-represented. That way I'd always have <i>at least</i> that percentage, as if they run out, people could jusrt use the general tickets.
</p>
<p>
    Some further research is needed for tooling that doesn't require everyone to have a Macbook...
</p>

<h3>Proportion of people who identify as under-represented in tech</h3>
<blockquote>Do you identify as under-represented in tech?</blockquote>
<p>
    I didn't focus on a particular way people could be underrepresented because while some are very visible (e.g. gender, race), some are less so (e.g. wealth, sexual orientation), and some can be not at all (e.g. mental health, some physical disabilities). It would be impossible for me to list them all and I don't want to unintentionally erase anyone, so I let people self-define.
</p>
<div id="graph_under_represented_self_define"></div>

<h3>Write-in for comments</h3>
<blockquote>Is there anything else you think we should do?</blockquote>
<p>
    I'm going to discuss all of these as there were some good points raised.
</p>
<h4>Confidence</h4>
<p>
    Some people were shy or worried about attending something like this. I'm hoping that being this open and transparent will help!
</p>
<h4>Targeting beginners</h4>
<p>
    I'll definitely be doing this for the first course.
</p>
<h4>Not expensive to attend</h4>
<p>
    The course will be free, and I need to research the way I would recommend people develop on a cheap machine e.g. a Chromebook.
</p>
<h4>Standalone sessions</h4>
<p>
    Each lesson will be about a specific thing, but towards the end of the course I might need to assume knowledge from previous sessions. It will be possible to catch up though! I'll put all the material online.
</p>
<h4>Short social afterwards</h4>
<p>
    I like this idea, and I'll see what I can do. It depends how late we have the venue until.
</p>
<h4>Experiment with course formats</h4>
<p>
    Yep. After this first one it will be interesting to see what works and what doesn't.
</p>
<h1>Findings</h1>
<p>
    I'm grateful for all the feedback I received. It's been really useful to confirm some theories I had about how I wanted to run this.
</p>
<p>
    To summarise what I'd like to do: one course of 6-8 sessions with individual sessions that would be useful as standalone or in small subsets. Free event but with ticketing (the capacity depends on venue) and a percentage (possibly two thirds) of the tickets being only for people who identify as under-represented in tech. Put course material online and figure out how to develop from a Chromebook.
</p>
<p>
    I'm picturing a set of lessons like this (although I'm open to ideas!):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>intro + concepts + starter HTML</li>
    <li>more HTML + starter CSS</li>
    <li>Twitter Bootstrap + responsiveness</li>
    <li>basic source control with Git + GitHub</li>
    <li>intro to JavaScript and jQuery</li>
    <li>more JavaScript and jQuery</li>
</ul>
