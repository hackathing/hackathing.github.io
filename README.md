# Hackathing Website
This is the website for the hackathing org. It uses Github Pages & Jekyll.

# Motivation
The idea is to briefly explain what a Hackathing is, show some photos of previous events, and have a link the eventbrite page for our next event.

# Contributing
We're happy for people to contribute (this could even be the bases for something to do at a Hackathing!), just use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests as normal.

If you're contributing photos and want to check them in to git, just be aware that they will be in version control for all time. You should get permission from everyone in the photo (and the person who took it if not you) after having explained this.
